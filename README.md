# Warehouse-Robots-Path-Planning
Designing an optimized path for multiple robots in a warehouse for picking and delivery operations using A* algorithm (shortest path) and linear programming (task allocation).
There are 3 scenarios
    1) Overall minimum cost/distance travelled by all the robots.
    2) Priority Task Allocation
    3) Multiple Load Capacity of robots
