# Warehouse-Robots-Path-Planning
Designing an optimized path for multiple robots in a warehouse for picking and delivery operations using A* algorithm (shortest path) and linear programming (task allocation).
There are 3 scenarios

    1) Total Minimum Cost
    2) Priority Task Allocation
    3) Multiple Load Capacity of robots

Warehouse Environment 

    1) Initially â†’ All robots at starting station (GREY)
    2) Picking Station (Purple)
    3) Delivery Station (Light Blue)
    4) Shelf / Inventory (BLACK)
    5) 6 Robots (EACH OF DIFFERENT COLOR)
    6) 6 Task Locations (GREEN)

Total Minimum Cost

       1) Shortest path distance (Cost) is calculated using A* algorithm for every robot-task pair (6 x 6 cost matrix)
       2) Min obj = sum_i,sum_j(r_i*cost(task_j))
       3) Constraints: Task_j  can be allocated to only unique robot

Priority Task Allocation

       1) Here Algorithm will not optimize the overall cost / distance of all 6 robots together like in above scenario.
       2) Nearest robot will be assigned to each task in decreasing order of priority P1>P2>P3>P4>P5>P6
       3) Priority varies from Brightest Yellow to Darkest Yellow

Load Capacity

       1) Here the load capacity of each robot is k (constant), for this example k=2
       2) Suppose 2 tasks are near each other then instead of 2 robots going to the individual task, 
          1 robot can complete both the tasks.

Comparison between A* and Dijkstra Algorithm for finding the shortest path between robot and an end point
( Why we have used A* and not Dijkstra for calculating the shortest path distance )

    1) A* is faster because it avoids searching extra nodes
    2) A* is also an informed search algorithm (takes goal state into account)
